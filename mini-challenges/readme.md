# Little Man Computer - Mini Challenges / Examples

Challenges and solutions. Write a program:

1. that loads and outputs the value 10. [Solution](mc-01-output-stored-value.asm "Solution")
2. that adds two inputs together and outputs the result. [Solution](mc-02-addition.asm "Solution")
3. that adds three inputs together and outputs the result. [Solution](mc-03-addition.asm "Solution")
4. that takes two inputs and subtracts the second from the first.
5. that outputs the larger of two input values.
6. that outputs the larger of three input values.
7. that takes three inputs and outputs them in ascending order.
8. that takes two inputs and subtracts the second from the first. If the result is negative, the program should subtract the first input from the second.
9. that counts down from any input value.
10. that outputs the product (multiplication) of two input values.
11. that outputs the quotient (division) of two input values.
12. that outputs the remainder of two input values.
13. that takes a series of positive numbers from the and adds them together. [Solution](mc-14-add-all-postive-numbers.asm "Solution")
